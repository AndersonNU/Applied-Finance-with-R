# Applied Finance with R
Course I took in datacamp.com

I explore to add and develop some financial projects using R. 

Bond valuation and analysis covers topics ranging from using R to develop a model to value a fixed interest rate bond, 
estimate and analyse a bond's yield (i.e., a measure of the opportunity cost of bond investors), 
and model techniques used to protect bond portfolios from changes in interest rates.
